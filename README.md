WIP

A collection of small, composable primitives for building backend systems — without becoming a platform.

Subspace is a set of narrowly scoped libraries that solve common infrastructure problems (caching, queues, locks, retries, telemetry, secrets, etc.) with explicit semantics, honest guarantees, and minimal coupling.

This is not a framework.
This is not an ecosystem.
Each package is designed to stand on its own.
